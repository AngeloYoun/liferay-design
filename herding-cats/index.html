							so our marketing leads brought design and development together and said ‚Äî here's an opportunity to create some leads by providing content that people want! 

							so they provided the Vision ‚Äî so while marketing started to research and write about the industrial application of Liferay, on the design side were already able to begin thinking and developing the components and styles we wanted to use, we were able to work with marketing as they developed the content. because we were have a component library, we're able to develop really quickly I believe we did all 6 of them in a single sprint ‚Äî so in addition to accomplishing the vision, we were able to do it in a really cost-effective way.
